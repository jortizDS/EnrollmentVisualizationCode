## Project Background 
As a woman in STEM, I often found myself reflecting on the changing makeup of my learning environments. I began my academic journey at an Elementary school on the Southwest side of Chicago, where 99% of students are underprivileged and Hispanic, and later attended Whitney Young, one of the most diverse high schools in the city. The shift to a predominantly white institution (PWI) like UIUC, and the noticeable lack of cultural, ethnic, and gender representation within my majorâ€”made me reflect on how diversity can look very different across academic spaces. That experience led me here. My goal was to turn personal curiosity into a resource that could help others better understand representation across departments.
